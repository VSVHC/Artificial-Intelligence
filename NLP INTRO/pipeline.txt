END - END FULL STACK DATASCIENTIST WORK -
------------------
1- EXTRACT THE DATASET FROM DB ( IF IT IS STRUCTURED DATA) ---> MACHINE L
2- EXTRACT THE DATASET FROM WEBSITE, DIRECT CLIENT, SPEECH, WEBSCRAPPING, IMAGES, VIDEOS ( UNSTRUCTURED DATA) ----> AI 
3- WRITE A QUEREY TO EXTRACT THE DATA BASED ON YOUR BUSINESS REQIREMENT
4- DATASET EXTRACT FROM DB
5- BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING // FEATURE UNDERSTANIN IS ESSENTIAL // YOU MIGHT TAKE 1 MONTH FOR THIS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTION YOU CAN ASK TO YOUR MANAGMENT
6- START WORKING DATA IMPUTATION // DATA CLEANSING PART ( MIGHT TAKE 6 mont - 1yr ) 
7- DECIDE WHICH IS DEPENDENT VARIABLE & WHICH ARE RELAVAT & IRRELAVANT ATTRIBUTE
8 - ONCE YOU DECIDE D.V THEN YOU COME TO KNOW WHEATURE PROBLEM STATEMENT IS REGRESS / CLASI
9- START WORKION ON EDA (VISUALIZATION). AS PER YOUR BUSINESS REQUIREMENT WHAT YOU NEED TO 
TRY TO PLOT NORMAL DISRTIBUTION GRAPH BASED ON YOUR ATTRIBUTE UNDERSTAN ( MEAN - MD - MODE)
10- DATA IS PROPER DISTRIBUTED
-------------------------------------------- (7 Months)
11- Dataset is ready ( i.v & i.v)
12- Import all necessary library & import dataset
13- Split the data into i.v & d.v
14- train-test-test
15- feature scaling required based on algorithm
16- model building using regression or classif algorithm
17- compare with test & prediction
18- build cm & ac /// AUC & ROC curve for classification 
19- k-fold cv
20- grid search cv // random search cv
21- you got to know optimla accurac based on highest %
22- test with future data to complare live scnarion and prediction 
22- joblib & Pickle 
23 - write a connect using flask, django, docker, kubernates // azure clod 
24- build the model your system ( amazon)
25 - all the work what ever you done this data is realation to application server not production 
26- application server is down but production should never be down ( 3-4 people ) 
27 - application server work whatever you done it will run fine 
same model when you push it to production everything ig getting error
1- production db time error  
2- security firewall error 
3- producion server never be a open source (use licensed software) 

=============================================
23- commit to git or you can save all the file in 1 folder share to the manager
24- flask application and fetch the model, joblib, pickle and write some function as   per the requiremet
25- create http:// (host) cross check
26- you need to test with future data
furture data you need to enter to db and then try to run the model and compare with real time. ( test -1,  2, 3)
==========================
26- you can send http: link to your manager for checking or testing
27- deployment
28- if you dont have front end and designer then  you have 99% - not your task)
29- permisin access for deply the model 
30- just deploy into production 
31- all of the codes suddenl get error 
32- 10 day you have day and night with entire team 
33- deployment will be done
34- model maintaince ( yesterday data)

35- keep update the model 1 week, 1 month, 1 daily)
========================
xml, pdf, webscraping, image, video
nlp
dl
cloud
======================
- what ever the prediction is done by model
- tomorw 10 record came to databse -- model store in db -- automatica new record predic is also done. 
- tableau is connect to the db wher emode is store and prediction is stored
- tableau live the automroe thse prediction will seen by your stack holder and customer

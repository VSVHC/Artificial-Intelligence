## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that focuses on training algorithms to learn patterns and representations directly from data. It involves building and training deep neural networks, which are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's neural networks.

## Main Features
Here are just a few of the things that Deep Learning does well:
The main features of Deep Learning include:

1. **Feature Extraction:** DL models can extract relevant features from raw data without manual feature engineering. This capability is particularly beneficial for complex data types like images, audio, and text.

2. **Deep Architectures:** DL models have deep architectures with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These architectures enable the learning of complex mappings and enable DL algorithms to model intricate relationships in data.

3. **Hierarchical Representation Learning:** DL algorithms automatically learn hierarchical representations of data. Lower layers capture simple features, and higher layers combine these features to learn more abstract and complex representations.

**Indeed parts of deep learning**

ANN, RNN, and CNN are fundamental parts of deep learning. They form the backbone of many deep learning models and are used extensively in various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, time series analysis, and more.

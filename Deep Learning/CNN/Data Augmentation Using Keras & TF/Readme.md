Data augmentation using Keras and TensorFlow is a technique employed in deep learning to artificially expand a dataset by creating variations of existing data samples. This process helps improve the generalization and robustness of machine learning models. By applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, shifting, and zooming to the input data, data augmentation diversifies the training set, making the model more adaptable to different real-world scenarios. Keras and TensorFlow provide convenient libraries and functions for implementing data augmentation seamlessly within deep learning pipelines, enhancing model performance and reliability.

Multiclass Categorization (CNN)refers to a deep learning approach that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying data into multiple categories or classes. CNNs are particularly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn and extract meaningful features from images. In Multiclass Categorization using CNNs, the network is trained on a dataset containing images belonging to different categories, and it learns to classify new images into one of these predefined categories with high accuracy. This technique is widely used in various applications such as object recognition, facial recognition, and scene understanding.
